XRPN is a stack-based programming language. It uses Reverse Polish Notation for calculations.
The language is a superset of FOCAL, implementing the full set of HP-41CX calculator commands.
XRPN is on-the-fly extensible. Language functions can be upgraded or implemented while programs are running.
It runs programs in text files or manually in debug mode (if no text file is supplied or when a program stops)
XRPN implements indirect adressing, self-modification and features well beyond the FOCAL language.
